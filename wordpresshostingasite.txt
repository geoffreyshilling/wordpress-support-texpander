WordPress.org does not provide hosting for sites, it provides the software for other people to use their own sites on their own hosts. The WordPress <a href="https://wordpress.org/about/philosophy/">philosophy</a> and bill of rights permit people to use WordPress software for any reason they want, without any enforcement over legality or illegality. We leave that up to the web hosts. In cases of theft, abuse, harassment, or other such behavior, your best recourse is to contact the web host directly. You can use WHOIS to determine where the site is hosted, as well as resources such as http://www.whoishostingthis.com to find relevant information.
