At this point, we've reached the limits of what most in the community here are willing to offer in their spare time (everyone here is a volunteer). You should consider hiring someone so that you can give them direct access to the site for a far more efficient fix than we can provide here.

Please try http://jobs.wordpress.net/ or https://jetpack.pro/ and do not accept any hire offers posted to these forums.

We will keep this thread open, unless it veers too far off course, in case someone from the community is willing to provide further help here for free.
