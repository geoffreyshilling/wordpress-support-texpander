Try <a href="https://wordpress.org/download/">downloading WordPress</a> again, access your server via <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/article/ftp-clients/">SFTP or FTP</a>, or a file manager in your hosting account's control panel, and delete then replace your copies of everything except the `wp-config.php` file and the `/wp-content/` directory with fresh copies from the download. This will effectively replace all of your core files without damaging your content and settings.

Some uploaders tend to be unreliable when overwriting files, so don't forget to delete the original files before replacing them.
