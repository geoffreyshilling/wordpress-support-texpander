The argument about whether or not WordPress and its themes and plugins are GPL is not something we're qualified to debate here. Certainly WordPress is licensed under <a href="https://wordpress.org/about/gpl/">GPLv2</a>, and all themes and plugins hosted on WordPress.org are required to be GPLv2 compatible in their entirety, so you are free to edit and redistribute as you see fit. If code is not licensed as GPLv2 (or later) compatible, we ask that you not bring it up here for discussion.
